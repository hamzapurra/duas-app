Verily! We have sent it (this Qur'an) down in the night of <i>Al-Qadr </i>(Decree)
And what will make you know what the night of <i>Al-Qadr </i>(Decree) is?
The night of <i>Al-Qadr </i>(Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and the <i>Ruh </i>[Jibrael (Gabriel)] by Allah's Permission with all Decrees,
Peace! (All that night, there is Peace and Goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.

Have you seen him who denies the Recompense?
That is he who repulses the orphan (harshly),
And urges not the feeding of <i>AlMiskin</i> (the poor),
So woe unto those performers of <i>Salat</i> (prayers) (hypocrites),
Who delay their <i>Salat</i> (prayer) from their stated fixed times,
Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men),
And refuse <i>Al-Ma'un</i> (small kindnesses e.g. salt, sugar, water, etc.).

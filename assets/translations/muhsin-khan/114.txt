Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind,
&quot;The King of mankind,
&quot;The <i>Ilah</i> (God) of mankind,
&quot;From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one's heart after one remembers Allah) ,
&quot;Who whispers in the breasts of mankind,
&quot;Of jinns and men.&quot;

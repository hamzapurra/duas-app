Have you (O Muhammad (<img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>)) not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant? [The elephant army which came from Yemen under the command of Abrahah Al-Ashram intending to destroy the Ka'bah<i> </i>at Makkah].
Did He not make their plot go astray?
And sent against them birds, in flocks,
Striking them with stones of <i>Sijjil</i>.
And made them like an empty field of stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).

<i>Ha-Mim.</i>
The revelation of the Book (this Qur'an) is from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth, and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned.
Say (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> to these pagans): &quot;Think! All that you invoke besides Allah show me! What have they created of the earth? Or have they a share in (the creation of) the heavens? Bring me a Book (revealed before this), or some trace of knowledge (in support of your claims), if you are truthful!&quot;
And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?
And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping.
And when Our Clear Verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say of the truth (this Qur'an), when it reaches them: &quot;This is plain magic!&quot;
Or say they: &quot;He (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) has fabricated it.&quot; Say: &quot;If I have fabricated it, still you have no power to support me against Allah. He knows best of what you say among yourselves concerning it (i.e. this Qur'an)! Sufficient is He for a witness between me and you! And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.&quot;
Say (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>):&quot;I am not a new thing among the Messengers (of Allah) (i.e. I am not the first Messenger) nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner.&quot;
Say: &quot;Tell me! If this (Qur'an) is from Allah, and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel ('Abdullah bin Salam ) testifies that this Qur'an is from Allah [like the Taurat (Torah)], so he believed (embraced Islam) while you are too proud (to believe).&quot; Verily! Allah guides not the people who are <i>Zalimun</i> (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doing).
And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): &quot;Had it (Islamic Monotheism to which Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> is inviting mankind) been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!&quot; And when they have not let themselves be guided by it (this Qur'an), they say: &quot;This is an ancient lie!&quot;
And before this was the Scripture of Musa (Moses) as a guide and a mercy. And this is a confirming Book (the Qur'an) in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong, and as glad tidings to the <i>Muhsinun</i> (good-doers - see V.2:112).
Verily, those who say: &quot;Our Lord is (only) Allah,&quot; and thereafter <i>Istaqamu</i> (i.e. stood firm and straight on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism by abstaining from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allah has forbidden and by performing all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained), on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever), a reward for what they used to do.
And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship and she brings him forth with hardship, and the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thirty (30) months, till when he attains full strength and reaches forty years, he says: &quot;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my off-spring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly, I am one of the Muslims (submitting to Your Will).&quot;
They are those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds. (They shall be) among the dwellers of Paradise, a promise of truth, which they have been promised.
But he who says to his parents: &quot;Fie upon you both! Do you hold out the promise to me that I shall be raised up (again) when generations before me have passed away (without rising)?&quot; While they (father and mother) invoke Allah for help (and rebuke their son): &quot;Woe to you! Believe! Verily, the Promise of Allah is true.&quot; But he says: &quot;This is nothing but the tales of the ancient.&quot;
They are those against whom the Word (of torment) is justified among the previous generations of jinns and mankind that have passed away. Verily! They are ever the losers.
And for all, there will be degrees according to that which they did, that He (Allah) may recompense them in full for their deeds. And they will not be wronged.
On the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): &quot;You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein. Now this Day you shall be recompensed with a torment of humiliation, because you were arrogant in the land without a right, and because you used to rebel and disobey (Allah).
And remember (Hud) the brother of 'Ad, when he warned his people in <i>Al-Ahqaf </i>(the curved sand-hills in the southern part of Arabian Peninsula). And surely, there have passed away warners before him and after him (saying): &quot;Worship none but Allah; truly, I fear for you the torment of a mighty Day.&quot;
They said: &quot;Have you come to turn us away from our <i>aliha </i>(gods)? Then bring us that with which you threaten us, if you are one of the truthful!&quot;
He said: &quot;The knowledge (of the time of its coming) is with Allah only, and I convey to you that wherewith I have been sent, but I see that you are a people given to ignorance!&quot;
Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: &quot;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&quot; Nay, but it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened! a wind wherein is a painful torment!
Destroying everything by the Command of its Lord! So they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings! Thus do We recompense the people who are <i>Mujrimun </i>(polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, etc.)!
And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraish)! And We had assigned them the (faculties of) hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and hearts, but their hearing (ears), seeing (eyes), and their hearts availed them nothing since they used to deny the <i>Ayat </i>(Allah's Prophets and their Prophethood, proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, and they were completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!
And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the <i>Ayat </i>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism).
Then why did those whom they had taken for <i>aliha </i>(gods) besides Allah, as a way of approach (to Allah) not help them? Nay, but they vanished completely from them (when there came the torment). And that was their lie, and their inventions which they had been inventing (before their destruction).
And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) <i>Nafran </i>(three to ten persons) of the jinns, (quietly) listening to the Qur'an, when they stood in the presence thereof, they said: &quot;Listen in silence!&quot; And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners.
They said: &quot;O our people! Verily! We have heard a Book (this Qur'an) sent down after Musa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to a Straight Path (i.e. Islam).
O our people! Respond (with obedience) to Allah's Caller (i.e. Allah's Messenger Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), and believe in him (i.e. believe in that which Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> has brought from Allah and follow him). He (Allah) will forgive you of your sins, and will save you from a painful torment (i.e. Hell-fire) .
&nbsp;And whosoever does not respond to Allah's Caller, he cannot escape on earth, and there will be no <i>Auliya' </i>(protectors) for him besides Allah (from Allah's Punishment). Those are in manifest error.
Do they not see that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead? Yes, He surely is Able to do all things.
And on the Day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said to them): &quot;Is this not the truth?&quot; They will say: &quot;Yes, By our Lord!&quot; He will say: &quot;Then taste the torment, because you used to disbelieve!&quot;
Therefore be patient (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day. (O mankind! This Qur'an is sufficient as) a clear Message (or proclamation to save yourself from destruction). But shall any be destroyed except the people who are <i>Al-Fasiqun </i>(the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).

Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah, the King (of everything), the Holy, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book (this Qur'an, Islamic laws and Islamic jurisprudence) and <i>Al-Hikmah</i> (<i>As-Sunnah</i>: legal ways, orders, acts of worship, etc. of Prophet Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>). And verily, they had been before in mainfest error;
And He has sent him (Prophet Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) also to others among them (Muslims) who have not yet joined them (but they will come). And He (Allah) is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
That is the Grace of Allah, which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is the Owner of Mighty Grace.
The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Taurat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its legal laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey who carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example (or the likeness) of people who deny the <i>Ayat </i>(proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are <i>Zalimun</i> (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).
Say (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>): &quot;O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allah, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.&quot;
But they will never long for it (death), because of what (deeds) their hands have sent before them! And Allah knows well the <i>Zalimun</i> (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).
Say (to them): &quot;Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to (Allah), the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will tell you what you used to do.&quot;
&nbsp;O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the <i>Salat</i> (prayer) on the day of Friday (<i>Jumu'ah</i> prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [<i>Jumu'ah</i> religious talk (<i>Khutbah</i>) and <i>Salat</i> (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you if you did but know!
Then when the (<i>Jumu'ah</i>) <i>Salat</i> (prayer) is finished, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah (by working, etc.), and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.
And when they see some merchandise or some amusement [beating of <i>Tambur </i>(drum) etc.] they disperse headlong to it, and leave you (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) standing [while delivering <i>Jumu'ah's </i>religious talk (<i>Khutbah</i>)]. Say &quot;That which Allah has is better than any amusement or merchandise! And Allah is the Best of providers.&quot;

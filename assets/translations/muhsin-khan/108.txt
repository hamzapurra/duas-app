Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad (<img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>)) <i>Al-Kauthar</i> (a river in Paradise);
Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only).
For he who makes you angry (O Muhammad (<img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>)), - he will be cut off (from every good thing in this world and in the Hereafter).

Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab (an uncle of the Prophet), and perish he!
His wealth and his children (etc.) will not benefit him!
He will be burnt in a Fire of blazing flames!
And his wife too, who carries wood (thorns of <i>Sadan</i> which she used to put on the way of the Prophet (<img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) , or use to slander him).
In her neck is a twisted rope of <i>Masad</i> (palm fibre).

Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak,
&quot;From the evil of what He has created;
&quot;And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness; (or the moon as it sets or goes away).
&quot;And from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots,
&quot;And from the evil of the envier when he envies.&quot;

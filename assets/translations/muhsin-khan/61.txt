Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?
Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do.
Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in rows (ranks) as if they were a solid structure .
And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: &quot;O my people! Why do you hurt me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger of Allah to you? So when they turned away (from the Path of Allah), Allah turned their hearts away (from the Right Path). And Allah guides not the people who are <i>Fasiqun </i>(rebellious, disobedient to Allah).
And (remember) when 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: &quot;O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you confirming the Taurat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmed . But when he (Ahmed i.e. Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) came to them with clear proofs, they said: &quot;This is plain magic.&quot;
And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah, while he is being invited to Islam? And Allah guides not the people who are <i>Zalimun</i> (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers) folk.
They intend to put out the Light of Allah (i.e. the religion of Islam, this Qur'an, and Prophet Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) with their mouths. But Allah will complete His Light even though the disbelievers hate (it).
He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islamic Monotheism) to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though the <i>Mushrikun</i> (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammed <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) hate (it).
O You who believe! Shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you from a painful torment.
&nbsp;That you believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know!
(If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwelling in Gardens of <i>'Adn</i> - Eternity [<i>'Adn </i>(Edn) Paradise], that is indeed the great success.
And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love, help from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) to the believers.
O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the Cause) of Allah as said 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), to <i>Al-Hawariun</i> (the disciples): &quot;Who are my helpers (in the Cause) of Allah?&quot; <i>Al-Hawarieen</i> (the disciples) said: &quot;We are Allah's helpers&quot; (i.e. we will strive in His Cause!). Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the uppermost.

The Event (the Hour or the punishment of disbelievers and polytheists or the Islamic laws or commandments), ordained by Allah will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate as partners with Him.
He sends down the angels with inspiration of His Command to whom of His slaves He pleases (saying): &quot;Warn mankind that <i>La ilaha illa Ana </i>(none has the right to be worshipped but I), so fear Me (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds).
He has created the heavens and the earth with truth. High be He Exalted above all they associate as partners with Him.
He has created man from <i>Nutfah </i>(mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge), then behold, this same (man) becomes an open opponent.
And the cattle, He has created them for you; in them there is warmth (warm clothing), and numerous benefits, and of them you eat.
And wherein is beauty for you, when you bring them home in the evening, and as you lead them forth to pasture in the morning.
And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is full of Kindness, Most Merciful.
And (He has created) horses, mules and donkeys, for you to ride and as an adornment. And He creates (other) things of which you have no knowledge.
And upon Allah is the responsibility to explain the Straight Path (i.e. Islamic Monotheism for mankind i.e. to show them legal and illegal, good and evil things, etc. so, whosoever accepts the guidance, it will be for his own benefit and whosoever goes astray, it will be for his own destruction), but there are ways that turn aside (such as Paganism, Judaism, Christianity, etc.). And had He willed, He would have guided you all (mankind).
He it is Who sends down water (rain) from the sky; from it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture;
With it He causes to grow for you the crops, the olives, the date-palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit. Verily! In this is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.
And He has subjected to you the night and the day, the sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected by His Command. Surely, in this are proofs for people who understand.
And whatsoever He has created for you on this earth of varying colours [and qualities from vegetation and fruits, etc. (botanical life) and from animal (zoological life)]. Verily! In this is a sign for people who remember.
And He it is Who has subjected the sea (to you), that you eat thereof fresh tender meat (i.e. fish), and that you bring forth out of it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships ploughing through it, that you may seek (thus) of His Bounty (by transporting the goods from place to place) and that you may be grateful.
And He has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you, and rivers and roads, that you may guide yourselves.
And landmarks (signposts, etc. during the day) and by the stars (during the night), they (mankind) guide themselves.
Is then He, Who creates as one who creates not? Will you not then remember?
And if you would count the graces of Allah, never could you be able to count them. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And Allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
Those whom they (<i>Al-Mushrikun</i><b> </b>) invoke besides Allah have not created anything, but are themselves created.
(They are) dead, lifeless, and they know not when they will be raised up.
Your <i>Ilah </i>(God) is One <i>Ilah </i>(God Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but He). But for those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts deny (the faith in the Oneness of Allah), and they are proud.
Certainly, Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Truly, He likes not the proud.
And when it is said to them: &quot;What is it that your Lord has sent down (unto Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>)?&quot; They say: &quot;Tales of the men of old!&quot;
They will bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!
Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.
Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them and will say: &quot;Where are My (so called) 'partners' concerning whom you used to disagree and dispute (with the believers, by defying and disobeying Allah)?&quot; Those who have been given the knowledge (about the Torment of Allah for the disbelievers) will say: &quot;Verily! Disgrace this Day and misery are upon the disbelievers.
&quot;Those whose lives the angels take while they are doing wrong to themselves (by disbelief and by associating partners in worship with Allah and by committing all kinds of crimes and evil deeds).&quot; Then, they will make (false) submission (saying): &quot;We used not to do any evil.&quot; (The angels will reply): &quot;Yes! Truly, Allah is All-Knower of what you used to do.
&quot;So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein<b> </b>, and indeed, what an evil abode will be for the arrogant.&quot;
And (when) it is said to those who are the <i>Muttaqun </i>(pious - see V.2:2) &quot;What is it that your Lord has sent down?&quot; They say: &quot;That which is good.&quot; For those who do good in this world, there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be better. And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of the <i>Muttaqun </i>(pious - see V.2:2).
<i>'Adn</i> (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity) which they will enter, under which rivers flow, they will have therein all that they wish. Thus Allah rewards the <i>Muttaqun </i>(pious - see V.2:2).
Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): <i>Salamun 'Alaikum</i> (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of (the good) which you used to do (in the world).&quot;
Do they (the disbelievers and polytheists) await but that the angels should come to them [to take away their souls (at death)], or there should come the command (i.e. the torment or the Day of Resurrection) of your Lord? Thus did those before them. And Allah wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.
Then, the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that at which they used to mock surrounded them.
And those who join others in worship with Allah say: &quot;If Allah had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped aught but Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without (Command from) Him.&quot; So did those before them. Then! Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey clearly the Message?
And verily, We have sent among every <i>Ummah</i> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &quot;Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) <i>Taghut</i> (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship <i>Taghut </i>besides Allah).&quot; Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth).
If you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) covet for their guidance<b> </b>, then verily Allah guides not those whom He makes to go astray (or none can guide him whom Allah sends astray). And they will have no helpers.
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths, that Allah will not raise up him who dies. Yes, (He will raise them up), a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not.
In order that He may make manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved (in Resurrection, and in the Oneness of Allah) may know that they were liars.
Verily! Our Word unto a thing when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: &quot;Be!&quot; and it is.
And as for those who emigrated for the Cause of Allah, after suffering oppression, We will certainly give them goodly residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater, if they but knew!
(They are) those who remained patient (in this world for Allah's sake), and put their trust in their Lord (Allah Alone).
And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) any but men, whom We inspired, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of Allah). So ask of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.
With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) the reminder and the advice (the Qur'an), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought.
Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not sink them into the earth, or that the torment will not seize them from directions they perceive not?
Or that He may catch them in the midst of their going to and fro (in their jobs), so that there be no escape for them (from Allah's Punishment)?
Or that He may catch them with gradual wasting (of their wealth and health). Truly! Your Lord is indeed full of Kindness, Most Merciful?
Have they not observed things that Allah has created, (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto Allah, and they are lowly?
And to Allah prostate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility].
They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.
And Allah said (O mankind!): &quot;Take not <i>ilahain </i>(two gods in worship, etc.). Verily, He (Allah) is (the) only One <i>Ilah </i>(God). Then, fear Me (Allah �� �����) much [and Me (Alone), i.e. be away from all kinds of sins and evil deeds that Allah has forbidden and do all that Allah has ordained and worship none but Allah]<b> </b>.
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and (all that is in) the earth and <i>Ad-Din Wasiba</i> is His [(i.e. perpetual sincere obedience to Allah is obligatory). None has the right to be worshipped but Allah)]. Will you then fear any other than Allah?
And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help.
Then, when He has removed the harm from you, behold! Some of you associate others in worship with their Lord (Allah).
So (as a result of that ) they deny (with ungratefulness) that (Allah's Favours) which We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy yourselves (your short stay), but you will come to know (with regrets).
And they assign a portion of that which We have provided them unto what they know not (false deities). By Allah, you shall certainly be questioned about (all) that you used to fabricate.
And they assign daughters unto Allah! Glorified (and Exalted) be He above all that they associate with Him! . And unto themselves what they desire;
And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward grief!
He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonour or bury her in the earth<b> </b>? Certainly, evil is their decision.
For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description, and for Allah is the highest description. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
And if Allah were to seize mankind for their wrong-doing, He would not leave on it (the earth) a single moving (living) creature, but He postpones them for an appointed term and when their term comes, neither can they delay nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment).
They assign to Allah that which they dislike (for themselves), and their tongues assert the falsehood that the better things will be theirs. No doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it, and left there neglected. (<i>Tafsir Al-Qurtubi</i>, Vol.10, Page 121)
By Allah, We indeed sent (Messengers) to the nations before you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), but <i>Shaitan</i> (Satan) made their deeds fair-seeming to them. So he (Satan) is their <i>Wali</i> (helper) today (i.e. in this world), and theirs will be a painful torment.
And We have not sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe.
And Allah sends down water (rain) from the sky, then He revives the earth therewith after its death. Verily, in this is a sign (clear proof) for people who listen (obey Allah).
And verily! In the cattle, there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.
And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you derive strong drink (this was before the order of the prohibition of the alcoholic drinks) and a goodly provision. Verily, therein is indeed a sign for people who have wisdom.
And your Lord inspired the bee, saying: &quot;Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect.
&quot;Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you).&quot; There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think.
And Allah has created you and then He will cause you to die, and of you there are some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after having known (much). Truly! Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.
And Allah has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties. Then, those who are preferred will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof<b> </b>. Do they then deny the Favour of Allah?
And Allah has made for you wives of your own kind, and has made for you, from your wives, sons and grandsons, and has bestowed on you good provision. Do they then believe in false deities and deny the Favour of Allah (by not worshipping Allah Alone).
And they worship others besides Allah, such as do not and cannot own any provision for them from the heavens or the earth.
So put not forward similitudes for Allah (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! Allah knows and you know not.
Allah puts forward the example (of two men a believer and a disbeliever); a slave (disbeliever) under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and (the other), a man (believer) on whom We have bestowed a good provision from Us, and He spends thereof secretly and openly. Can they be equal? (By no means, not). All the praises and thanks be to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them know not.
And Allah puts forward (another) example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything (disbeliever), and he is a burden to his master, whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one (believer in the Islamic Monotheism) who commands justice, and is himself on a Straight Path?
And to Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Truly! Allah is Able to do all things.
And Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing. And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts that you might give thanks (to Allah).
Do they not see the birds held (flying) in the midst of the sky? None holds them but Allah [none gave them the ability to fly but Allah]. Verily, in this are clear proofs and signs for people who believe (in the Oneness of Allah).
And Allah has made for you in your homes an abode, and made for you out of the hides of the cattle (tents for) dwelling, which you find so light (and handy) when you travel and when you stay (in your travels), and of their wool, fur, and hair (sheep wool, camel fur, and goat hair), a furnishing and articles of convenience (e.g. carpets, blankets, etc.), a comfort for a while.
And Allah has made for you out of that which He has created shades, and has made for you places of refuge in the mountains, and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He perfect His Grace unto you, that you may submit yourselves to His Will (in Islam).
Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way.
They recognise the Grace of Allah, yet they deny it (by worshipping others besides Allah) and most of them are disbelievers (deny the Prophethood of Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>).
And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up from each nation a witness (their Messenger), then, those who have disbelieved will not be given leave (to put forward excuses), nor will they be allowed (to return to the world) to repent and ask for Allah's Forgiveness (of their sins, etc.).
And when those who did wrong (the disbelievers) will see the torment, then it will not be lightened unto them, nor will they be given respite.
And when those who associated partners with Allah see their (Allah's so-called) partners, they will say: &quot;Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to invoke besides you.&quot; But they will throw back their word at them (and say): &quot;Surely! You indeed are liars!&quot;
And they will offer (their full) submission to Allah (Alone) on that Day, and their invented false deities [all that they used to invoke besides Allah, e.g. idols, saints, priests, monks, angels, jinns, Jibrael (Gabriel), Messengers, etc.] will vanish from them.
Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah, for them We will add torment over the torment; because they used to spread corruption [by disobeying Allah themselves, as well as ordering others (mankind) to do so].
And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst themselves. And We shall bring you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) as a witness against these. And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims).
Verily, Allah enjoins <i>Al-Adl </i>(i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allah Alone - Islamic Monotheism) and <i>Al-Ihsan</i> [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allah, totally for Allah's sake and in accordance with the <i>Sunnah </i>(legal ways) of the Prophet <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin<b> </b> (i.e. all that Allah has ordered you to give them e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help, etc.): and forbids <i>Al-Fahsha'</i> (i.e all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right, etc.), and <i>Al-Munkar</i> (i.e all that is prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds, etc.), and <i>Al-Baghy</i> (i.e. all kinds of oppression), He admonishes you, that you may take heed.
And fulfill the Covenant of Allah (<i>Bai'a</i>: pledge for Islam) when you have covenanted, and break not the oaths after you have confirmed them, and indeed you have appointed Allah your surety. Verily! Allah knows what you do.
And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has become strong, by taking your oaths a means of deception among yourselves, lest a nation may be more numerous than another nation. Allah only tests you by this [i.e who obeys Allah and fulfills Allah's Covenant and who disobeys Allah and breaks Allah's Covenant]. And on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly make clear to you that wherein you used to differ [i.e. a believer confesses and believes in the Oneness of Allah and in the Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> which the disbeliever denies it and that was their difference amongst them in the life of this world]<b> </b>.
And had Allah willed, He could have made you (all) one nation, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. But you shall certainly be called to account for what you used to do.
And make not your oaths, a means of deception among yourselves, lest a foot may slip after being firmly planted, and you may have to taste the evil (punishment in this world) of having hindered (men) from the Path of Allah (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger, Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), and yours will be a great torment (i.e. the Fire of Hell in the Hereafter).
And purchase not a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant. Verily! What is with Allah is better for you if you did but know.
Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever with Allah (of good deeds) will remain. And those who are patient, We will certainly pay them a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do<b> </b>.
Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).
So when you want to recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah from <i>Shaitan</i> (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one).
Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah).
His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah) [i.e. those who are <i>Mushrikun</i> - polytheists - see Verse 6:121].
And when We change a Verse [of the Qur'an, i.e. cancel (abrogate) its order] in place of another, and Allah knows the best of what He sends down, they (the disbelievers) say: &quot;You (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) are but a <i>Muftari</i>! (forger, liar).&quot; Nay, but most of them know not.
Say (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) <i>Ruh-ul-Qudus </i>[Jibrael (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Qur'an) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allah as Muslims).
And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: &quot;It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>).&quot; The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur'an) is a clear Arabic tongue.
Verily! Those who believe not in the <i>Ayat </i>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, Allah will not guide them and theirs will be a painful torment.
It is only those who believe not in the <i>Ayat </i>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars.
Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment.
That is because they loved and preferred the life of this world over that of the Hereafter. And Allah guides not the people who disbelieve.
They are those upon whose hearts, hearing (ears) and sight (eyes) Allah has set a seal. And they are the heedless!
No doubt, in the Hereafter, they will be the losers.
Then, verily! Your Lord for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward is, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
(Remember) the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly.
And Allah puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt secure and well content; its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of Allah (with ungratefulness). So Allah made it taste the extreme of hunger (famine) and fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) which they (its people) used to do<b> </b>.
And verily, there had come unto them a Messenger (Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment overtook them while they were <i>Zalimun</i> (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).
So eat of the lawful and good food<b> </b> which Allah has provided for you. And be grateful for the Graces of Allah, if it is He Whom you worship.
He has forbidden you only <i>Al-Maytatah</i> (meat of a dead animal), blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols etc. or on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, and not transgressing, then, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: &quot;This is lawful and this is forbidden,&quot; so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.
A passing brief enjoyment (will be theirs), but they will have a painful torment.
And unto those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) before [in <i>Surat-Al-An'am,</i> (The Cattle), see Verse 6:146]. And We wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.
Then, verily! Your Lord for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to Allah) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Verily, Ibrahim (Abraham) was an <i>Ummah</i> (a leader having all the good righteous qualities), or a nation, obedient to Allah, <i>Hanifa </i>(i.e. to worship none but Allah), and he was not one of those who were <i>Al-Mushrikun</i> (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, and those who joined partners with Allah).
(He was) thankful for His (Allah's) Graces. He (Allah) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a Straight Path (Islamic Monotheism, neither Judaism nor Christianity<b> </b>).
And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.
Then, We have inspired you (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24> saying): &quot;Follow the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) <i>Hanifa</i> (Islamic Monotheism<b> </b> - to worship none but Allah) and he was not of the <i>Mushrikun</i> (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers, etc.).
The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.
Invite (mankind, O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Inspiration and the Qur'an) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided.
And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allah), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for <i>As-Sabirin </i>(the patient ones, etc.)<b> </b>.
And endure you patiently (O Muhammad <img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>), your patience is not but from Allah. And grieve not over them (polytheists and pagans, etc.), and be not distressed because of what they plot.
Truly, Allah is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him)<b> </b>, and those who are <i>Muhsinun </i>(good-doers, - see the footnote of V.9:120).

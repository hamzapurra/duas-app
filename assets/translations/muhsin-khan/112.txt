Say (O Muhammad (<img src=images/saws.gif width=25 height=24>)): &quot;He is Allah, (the) One.
&quot;<i>Allah-us-Samad </i>(The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks).
&quot;He begets not, nor was He begotten;
&quot;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&quot;
